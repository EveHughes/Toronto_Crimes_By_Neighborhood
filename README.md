## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were debugged and evaluated using ChatGPT. The written sections were entirely completed without the help of ChatGPT. All coding elements (including graphs and tables) were initially coded without ChatGPT but may have been later ran through ChatGPT for debugging and correcting purposes. Many uncertainties that occured during the coding process were also solved with the help of ChatGPT.
